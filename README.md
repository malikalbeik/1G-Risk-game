# 1G-Risk-game
Risk is a challenging board game that is based on strategy and trying to rule the world. It is group 1G's project for Bilkent's CS319 course

## Description
Our Project is the Classic Risk board game, with some enhancements and additions to make the game even more fun and entertaining. 

The game is centered over the world map in which players have to try and conquer as much of the world as they can. Players are given some infantry at the start of the game depending on the number of the players in the game and after that each player is given extra infantry in relation to the number of countries and contents that are under their control.

## Implementation
We will be implementing this game in React.js, as it is a framework that is versatile, Powerful, and easy to learn. Also as React.js is client side rendered there will be no need for any servers or infrastructure, just a file hosting service will suffice.

## Features
Features that we are planning on implementing include:
- The general game play rules
- A Responsive Desgin that is easy to use on all screens
- Score board of previous players
- The ability to save and load games
- And More to be thought of
